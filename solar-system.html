        <h2>Sun Facts</h2>
        <p>The Sun (or Sol), is the star at the centre of our solar system and is responsible for the Earth’s climate and weather. The Sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just 10km in diameter between the poles and the equator. The average radius of the Sun is 695,508 km (109.2 x that of the Earth) of which 20–25% is the core.</p>

        <h3>Sun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Sun is all the colours mixed together, this appears white to our eyes.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Sun is composed of hydrogen (70%) and Helium (28%).</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Sun is a main-sequence G2V star (or Yellow Dwarf).</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Sun is 109 times wider than the Earth and 330,000 times as massive.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth’s.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>The distance between the Earth and the Sun is an Astronomical Unit (AU)</strong></li>
            <li>
                <strong>One million Earths could fit inside the Sun.</strong>
                <p>A hollow Sun would fit around 960,000 spherical Earths. If squished inside with no wasted space, then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth’s.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System.</strong>
                <p>The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth. It is almost three quarters Hydrogen, whilst most of the remaining mass is Helium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Sun is an almost perfect sphere.</strong>
                <p>There is a 10 kilometre difference between the Sun’s polar and equatorial diameter. This means it is the closest thing to a perfect sphere that has been observed in nature.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Sun will consume the Earth.</strong>
                <p>When the Sun has burned all its Hydrogen, it will continue to burn helium for 130 million more years. During this time it will expand to the point that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and the Earth. At this stage it will have become a red giant</p>

        <h2>Solar System Facts</h2>
        <p>The solar system was formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago by the collapse of a giant molecular cloud. The mass at its centre collected to form the Sun and a flat disk of dust around it. This eventually formed the planets and other bodies of the solar system.</p>
