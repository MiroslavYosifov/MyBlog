    <p>The Earth has a single moon; the Moon sometime also referred to as Luna.</p>
    <h3>Mars’ Moons – 2</h3>
    <p>Mars has two moons called Phobos and Deimos. They were discovered in 1877 by astronomer Asaph Hall, who named them for the Latin terms “fear” and “panic”. These moons are thought to be captured asteroids and are among the smallest natural satellites in the solar system.</p>
